            <p>
                I embarked on my programming journey three years ago, starting with self-directed learning through YouTube tutorials and online resources before attending the INQOO Bootcamp. Since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, culminating in the creation of my first project, an initial portfolio website. Known for being easygoing with a great sense of humor, I thoroughly enjoy collaborative work and thrive in team environments. Patience and a strong work ethic drive me as I continue to expand my programming skills and knowledge.

                    <p>In the typing game, players have 30 seconds to start typing as many words as possible.

                    <p>Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O." The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a win for one player or a draw if the grid is fully occupied without any player achieving three in a row. This simple yet strategic game helps improve critical thinking and planning skills.</p>
